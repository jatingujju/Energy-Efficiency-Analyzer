# Energy-Efficiency-Analyzer
This is a complete, self-contained Python script for time-series analysis on building energy consumption data. It uses machine learning (XGBoost) to understand typical usage patterns, detect anomalous consumption (potential energy wastage), and generate an hourly forecast for the future.
